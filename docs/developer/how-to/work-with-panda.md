# How to work with panda

Use `ping bl22i-mo-panda-01` to get the IP address of the panda controller panel.

Layout view shows a board with skeuomorphic drag and drop interface. 

`stoflow.py` needs for this configuration to have OUT on OUTB and hooked to the TTLOUT.

Also see [comparison with other beamlines PandA-Zebra-TFG system]([url](https://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/display/~qvr31998/Spectroscopy+TFG-II+notes)).

It is quite useful to have TTLOUTs labeled for clarity. 

One of the valid detectors are the tetrAMMs (saxs, waxs, i0, i0).
